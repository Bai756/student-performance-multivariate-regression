# Multivariate Regression
This program performs multivariate regression without sklearn.
It takes into account the hours studied, previous scores, hours slept, extracurricular activites, and sample question papers practices to determine the performance of a student.
It shows the graphs at the end
## Graphs
Shows a graph of the error for each iteration. 
Then the change in theta over time. 
Another graph for the predictions vs actual values.
And a last graph of all the x values graphed with extracurriculars taken into account with the score and a regression line.
# Conclusion
The previous score is the main factor in predicting the performance with hours studied second. The others are negligible as shown in the change in theta change graph.
